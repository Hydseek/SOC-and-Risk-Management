# 🛡 SOC & Risk Management Engineering

This repository documents structured research and applied analysis in:

- Security Operations Center (SOC) practices
- Risk Management methodologies
- Threat Modeling (STRIDE, TARA)
- Incident Response frameworks
- Risk-based security architecture

The goal is to bridge operational security (monitoring & detection) with strategic security (risk governance & mitigation).

## 🧠 Philosophy

A SOC without risk context generates noise.  
Risk management without operational visibility creates blind spots.

Security maturity comes from combining both.
